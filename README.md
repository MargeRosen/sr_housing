Our submission is for Challenge #3: Build an app that provides an example of an Awesome Hackathon submission.

After deeper research and consulting with HUD and Socrata reps we iterated and
pivoted at lunchtime on Satuday.

###Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:

* Research current public and government applications for senior housing
