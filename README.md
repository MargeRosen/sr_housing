Zillow & The University of Washington Host "Hack Housing: Empowering Smarter
Decisions" – A Weekend Hackathon Contest. #zillow-hackhousing

###Challenge and Approach

####The Problem

Chronic illness, falls, and the debilitation that comes with aging often
means seniors need to move to Assisted Living Centers, Adult Family Homes, or
Skilled Nursing Facilities.

This can be a very stressful, unwelcomed transition for the senior and the
burden often falls to adult children to help their parents find the right
facility, in the needed location, that’s affordable.

This is a big decision. Finding and researching senior facilities takes
too much time.  Most people do not know where to find government data necessary
to make good decisions.


####The Solution

Golden Guide is a platform to easily find all the senior housing information
you need to help make the right choice for you or your loved ones!

Develop a platform -- ONE place to find all the senior housing data:

* Facility and elder service details
* Location and current openings
* Monthly costs
* Government ratings for safety and quality evauations from data.medicare.gov
* State, city inspection reports
* Cusomer reviews.


###Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:

* Research current public and government applications for senior housing
* Lean Canvass for Business Model
* Design and wireframes
* Develop an example Git repository
* Stub a basic Ruby on Rails app
* CRUD for User reviews
* Shared on Github
* Consult with HUD and Socrata experts
* Deeper research into government datasets
* Iterated and re-designed
