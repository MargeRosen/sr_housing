    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Last Revised February 7, 2015</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Golden Guide we have a few fundamental principles:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
    <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
    <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
    <li>In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>

  <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.</p>

  <p>It is Golden Guide’s (“Golden Guide” or “Company”) policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

  <h3>Website Visitors</h3>

  <p>Like most website operators, Golden Guide collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Golden Guide’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Golden Guide may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

  <p>Golden Guide also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Golden Guide.com blogs. Golden Guide only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>

  <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

  <p>Certain visitors to Golden Guide’s websites choose to interact with Golden Guide in ways that require Golden Guide to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Golden Guide gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at Golden Guide to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Golden Guide – by purchasing access to the Akismet comment spam prevention service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Golden Guide collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Golden Guide. Golden Guide does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

  <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

  <p>Golden Guide may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Golden Guide may monitor the most popular blogs on the WordPress.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. Golden Guide may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Golden Guide does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

  <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

  <p>Golden Guide discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Golden Guide’s behalf or to provide services available at Golden Guide’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Golden Guide’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Golden Guide will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Golden Guide discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally- identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Golden Guide believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Golden Guide, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Golden Guide website and have supplied your email address, Golden Guide may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Golden Guide and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Golden Guide takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

  <h3>Web Site Navigational Information</h3>

  <p>Golden Guide uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Company’s Web site (“Web Site Navigational Information”). This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information that may be collected on the Company’s Web site and how this information may be used.</p>

  <p><strong>Cookies</strong> - Golden Guide uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web site easy and meaningful. When you visit the Company’s Web site, Golden Guide’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Golden Guide, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Apply” Web form), you remain anonymous to the Company. Golden Guide uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.</p>

  <p>If you have chosen to identify yourself to Golden Guide, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Services, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed your browser. These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Services and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Services.</p>

  <p>Golden Guide uses persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Company’s Web site. When you purchase the Services or provide the Company with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company places on your Web browser. The Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company’s Web site, but you will not be able to successfully use the Services.</p>

  <p>Golden Guide may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with Data About Golden Guide Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Services.</p>

  <p><strong>Web Beacons</strong> - Golden Guide uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web site and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. For example, Golden Guide may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Company’s Web site. Golden Guide uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s Web site and email communications.</p>

  <p>Golden Guide may use information from Web beacons in combination with Data About Golden Guide Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Services.</p>

  <p><strong>Flash Cookies</strong> - Golden Guide may use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit. Third parties, with whom the Company partners to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.</p>

  <p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.</p>

  <p><strong>Addresses</strong> - When you visit Golden Guide’s Web site, the Company collects your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, Golden Guide uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Company’s Web site.</p>

  <p><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong> - From time-to-time, Golden Guide engages third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from individuals who visit the Company’s Web site. Golden Guide may also use other third-party cookies to track the performance of Company advertisements. The information provided to third parties does not include personal information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after the Company receives it.</p>

  <p>Golden Guide may also contract with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other Web Site Navigational Information on the Company’s Web site and emails and on third-party Web sites. Ad networks follow your online activities over time by collecting Web Site Navigational Information through automated means, including through the use of cookies. They use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements on other Web sites. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.</p>

  <h3>International Transfer of Information Collected</h3>

  <p>To facilitate Golden Guide’s global operations, the Company may transfer and access Data About Golden Guide Customers from around the world, including the United States. This Privacy Statement shall apply even if Golden Guide transfers Data About Golden Guide Customers to other countries.</p>

  <h3>Business Transfers</h3>

  <p>If Golden Guide, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Golden Guide goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Golden Guide may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

  <h3>Ads</h3>

  <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Golden Guide and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

  <h3>Comments</h3>

  <p>Comments and other content submitted to our Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.</p>

  <h3>Correcting and Updating Your Information</h3>

  <p>Customers may update or change their registration information by logging in to their accounts at <a href='http://Golden Guide.com'>http://Golden Guide.com</a>. Requests to access, change, or delete your information will be handled within 30 days.</p>

  <h3>Security</h3>

  <p>Each Account holder is assigned a unique user name and password, which is required to access their Account. It is each user’s responsibility to protect the security of his or her login information. Golden Guide uses appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect Data About Golden Guide Customers.</p>

  <p>These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of data, but NO GUARANTY CAN BE MADE THAT YOUR INFORMATION AND DATA WILL BE SECURE FROM INTRUSIONS AND UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE TO THIRD PARTIES.</p>

Golden Guide encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
